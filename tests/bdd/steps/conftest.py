"""Steps shared by more than one feature file.

pytest-bdd resolves a step from the module that called `scenarios()` and from
`conftest.py` — **not** from a sibling `test_*.py`. So the moment a second
feature file needs `Given Ada is signed in`, the choice is to copy the
definition or to move it down here. Copying is how a suite ends up with four
subtly different versions of its most-used step.

What belongs here is the vocabulary every feature speaks: who is signed in,
which channels exist, what is in whose sidebar. What stays in a
`test_*_steps.py` is the phrasing that feature introduced — adding a member
belongs to `permissions.feature`, dropping the network to `realtime.feature`.

No selectors here either. A step says what a person did; the page object
(`tests/bdd/pages/`) knows what to click.
